# Social Media Platform: Thoughts
A social media platform (think Twitter/Bluesky), where you post "thoughts". A "thougt" (analog a tweet / post etc.) will automatically be deleted after 24h. Unless a user is "keeping it alive" (either a special action, or maybe just link it to likes, sharing and other positive interactions?). But a user can do this only once. A keep alive will set the "thought's" expiration time to 24h into the future of the keep alive interaction. So as long as there are new users keeping the thought alive, it will stay on the platform. If there are no new users, the thought will be deleted after the expiration time is reached.

Interactions with "thoughts":

- like & dislike, but actual number are only visible to the "thought" author
- sharing?
- commenting in some way shape of form?

Users can follow other users and see their "thoughts". Hashtag-based topic screaming is possible in order to find "thoughts" about specific things easier.
